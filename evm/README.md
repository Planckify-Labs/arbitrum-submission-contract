# TakumiPay — EVM (Foundry)

Solidity implementation of the merchant-payment contract that also exists on
[Stellar](../stellar) and [Solana](../solana/programs/takumi_pay). Owner/admin roles,
pausing, backend-signed merchant payment quotes with replay protection, a platform-fee
treasury, per-token spending limits, generic booking transactions, point deposits, and
timelocked withdrawals.

Deployed behind a UUPS (ERC-1967) proxy.

## Why this isn't a line-for-line port

- **Native and ERC-20 need separate code paths.** On Stellar, XLM is itself a token
  contract (SEP-41), so every entrypoint takes a single address. Here `address(0)`
  means native (ETH, MATIC, …) and each value-in entrypoint branches on it. Native is
  still gated by the same allowlist as any ERC-20 — there is no implicit bypass, so
  `addAllowedPaymentToken(address(0))` is a required post-deploy step if you accept it.
- **Quotes are verified with EIP-712 + `ecrecover`**, not `ed25519_verify` (Stellar) or
  an auxiliary instruction check (Solana). The EIP-712 domain separator binds a
  signature to this chain and this deployment, the same role Stellar's
  `QuoteMessage { network_id, contract, quote }` wrapper plays.
- **`refId` replay keys are `keccak256` of the string**, computed on-chain.
- **Fee-on-transfer tokens are rejected**, not accommodated: every ERC-20 pull asserts
  the received balance delta equals the requested amount (`_pullToken`). Stellar has no
  equivalent because SEP-41 transfers cannot skim.

## Layout

```
src/TakumiPay.sol          the contract — single flat implementation
script/DeployTakumiPay.s.sol
                           DeployTakumiPay (fresh proxy) + UpgradeTakumiPay (new impl)
test/TakumiPayProduction.t.sol    pause, spending limits, batching, allowlist, withdrawals, upgrades
test/TakumiPayMerchant.t.sol      processMerchantPayment, quote validation, treasury sweeps, signer rotation
test/TakumiPayPointDeposit.t.sol  depositPoints and the payment-token allowlist
deployments/<chainId>.json        deployment record, written by the deploy script
```

## Payment token allowlist

A single `allowedPaymentTokens` list gates **every** entrypoint that moves value in:

| Entrypoint | Gated |
|---|---|
| `createTransaction` | ✅ |
| `createTransactionBatch` | ✅ (phase 1, before any transfer) |
| `processMerchantPayment` | ✅ |
| `depositPoints` | ✅ |

This mirrors Stellar's `AllowedPaymentToken`. A freshly deployed contract accepts
**nothing** until the owner allowlists tokens:

```sh
cast send $PROXY "addAllowedPaymentToken(address)" $USDC --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PK
cast send $PROXY "addAllowedPaymentToken(address)" 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 ...  # native
```

## Treasury sweep rate limit

`sweepMerchantBacking` / `sweepPlatformFees` deliberately skip the withdrawal
timelock — merchant float has to settle daily and a 7-day queue would break that.
A per-token rolling 24h cap bounds the damage instead:

```sh
# Sweeps fail closed. A fresh deploy can sweep nothing until this is set.
cast send $PROXY "queueSweepCap(address,uint256)" $USDC 50000000000 ...
cast send $PROXY "applySweepCap(address)" $USDC ...
```

**Loosening a control is never a single call.** Raising a sweep cap, or lowering
`withdrawalDelay`, must be queued and is itself subject to the delay currently in
force. Tightening (lowering a cap, raising the delay) is immediate. Without this,
the timelock would be decorative — an owner key that leaked could call
`setWithdrawalDelay(0)` and `withdraw()` in the same transaction.

| Action | Path |
|---|---|
| Raise `withdrawalDelay` | `setWithdrawalDelay` — immediate |
| Lower `withdrawalDelay` | `queueWithdrawalDelay` → wait → `applyWithdrawalDelay` |
| Lower `sweepCap` | `setSweepCap` — immediate |
| Raise `sweepCap` | `queueSweepCap` → wait → `applySweepCap` |

> **Known limit.** With a single-EOA owner these controls bound the blast radius
> of a leaked key; they do not eliminate it. `upgradeToAndCall` is still owner-only
> and instant, so an attacker holding the owner key can upgrade to a malicious
> implementation and bypass everything. Closing that needs either a timelocked
> upgrade path or a multisig owner.

## Build

```sh
forge build
```

## Test

```sh
forge test
forge test --match-path test/TakumiPayMerchant.t.sol -vvv
```

## Deploy

```sh
export RPC_URL=...
export BACKEND_SIGNER=0x...        # address that signs EIP-712 quotes
export INITIAL_OWNER=0x...         # optional; defaults to the deployer

forge script script/DeployTakumiPay.s.sol:DeployTakumiPay \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify
```

`initialize(owner, backendSigner)` runs atomically with the proxy deployment, so there
is no window in which an uninitialized proxy is live.

## Upgrade

```sh
PROXY_ADDRESS=0x... forge script script/DeployTakumiPay.s.sol:UpgradeTakumiPay \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify
```

Storage layout must never be reordered — append only, and decrement `__gap` when adding
state. Verify with `forge inspect TakumiPay storageLayout` before every upgrade.
